# RRV Platform Subgraph

## Overview

The <a href="https://thegraph.com/hosted-service/subgraph/victortanzy123/rrv-platform-sepolia-v2">RRV Platform Subgraph</a> deployed via The Graph Protocol on `Sepolia Testnet` enables real-time syncing and indexing of event logs emitted from the RRV Platform Creator Smart Contract, and acts as a database with intemediate data processing, storage and query endpoints via `GraphQL` Framework.
